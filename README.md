# B10RL8W

Central impl repository for our RL project

# TODO

- determine technologies
- determine project
- do the project

Only 3 steps to go, so I'd say we're off to a good start!

# Contribution Guidelines 

- Be one of the project collaborators (we are easily startled by strangers)
- Do not merge to master without a PR (though you may approve your own PR)
- Squash commits when merging PRs
- Resolve conflicts with rebase (not merge- @DuncanWalter can answer questions)
